## Session 1: AstroNvim Setup and Configuration

### Goal: Set up and configure AstroNvim.

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    - Created a `.gemini` folder to store session-related information.
    - Created a `GEMINI.md` file with setup instructions for the user's AstroNvim configuration.

2.  **Show Gitignored and Dotfiles:**
    - The user wanted to see files ignored by git and files starting with a dot (`.`).
    - **Action:** Configured `telescope.nvim` and `neo-tree.nvim` to show hidden and gitignored files.
    - **Details:**
        - Initially, the configuration was placed in `lua/user/plugins/`, which was not being loaded.
        - Corrected the configuration by moving the settings to `lua/plugins/user.lua`.
        - Activated `lua/plugins/user.lua` by removing the line that disabled it.
        - Removed the unused `lua/user` directory.
    - **Result:** The user confirmed that they can now see the previously hidden files in the file tree.

3.  **Theme Configuration:**
    - The user asked how to change color themes.
    - **Action:** Explained how to use the theme selector with `<Leader>ft`.
    - **Action:** Installed the `tokyonight` and `catppuccin` themes.
    - **Action:** Set `catppuccin` with the "mocha" flavor as the default theme.
    - **Action:** Changed the `catppuccin` flavor to "frappe" at the user's request.
    - **Result:** The user is now able to switch themes and has a new default theme set.
