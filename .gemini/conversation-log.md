## Session 1: AstroNvim Setup and Configuration

### Goal: Set up and configure AstroNvim.

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    - Created a `.gemini` folder to store session-related information.
    - Created a `GEMINI.md` file with setup instructions for the user's AstroNvim configuration.

2.  **Show Gitignored and Dotfiles:**
    - The user wanted to see files ignored by git and files starting with a dot (`.`).
    - **Action:** Configured `telescope.nvim` and `neo-tree.nvim` to show hidden and gitignored files.
    - **Details:**
        - Initially, the configuration was placed in `lua/user/plugins/`, which was not being loaded.
        - Corrected the configuration by moving the settings to `lua/plugins/user.lua`.
        - Activated `lua/plugins/user.lua` by removing the line that disabled it.
        - Removed the unused `lua/user` directory.
    - **Result:** The user confirmed that they can now see the previously hidden files in the file tree.

3.  **Theme Configuration:**
    - The user asked how to change color themes.
    - **Action:** Explained how to use the theme selector with `<Leader>ft`.
    - **Action:** Installed the `tokyonight` and `catppuccin` themes.
    - **Action:** Set `catppuccin` with the "mocha" flavor as the default theme.
    - **Action:** Changed the `catppuccin` flavor to "frappe" at the user's request.
    - **Result:** The user is now able to switch themes and has a new default theme set.

4.  **Formatting and Indentation:**
    - The user requested to disable automatic formatting on save and set the global indentation to 4 spaces.
    - **Action:** Enabled and modified `lua/plugins/astrolsp.lua` to disable `format_on_save`.
    - **Action:** Enabled and modified `lua/plugins/astrocore.lua` to set `tabstop` and `shiftwidth` to `4`.
    - **Bug:** Introduced a syntax error in `lua/plugins/astrocore.lua` during the modification.
    - **Fix:** Corrected the syntax error in `lua/plugins/astrocore.lua`.
    - **Result:** Format-on-save is now disabled, and the indentation is set to 4 spaces.

5.  **Buffer Switching:**
    - The user asked about the keybindings for switching between buffers.
    - After some clarification, it was determined that the user wanted a way to open a Telescope list of all open buffers.
    - **Action:** Added a new keymap `<Leader>bl` to `lua/plugins/astrocore.lua` that opens the Telescope buffer list.
    - **Action:** Changed the next/previous buffer keymaps from `]b`/`[b` to `<C-l>`/`<C-h>`.
    - **Bug:** The `<C-l>`/`<C-h>` keymaps were unreliable due to conflicts with default Neovim behavior.
    - **Fix:** Changed the buffer switching keymaps to `<S-l>` (next) and `<S-h>` (previous) to resolve the conflict.
    - **Result:** The user can now press `<Leader>bl` to get a pop-up list of all open buffers and use `<S-l>`/`<S-h>` to cycle through them reliably.
